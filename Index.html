		I played there for about 3 years and in that time, my team won 1st place in a tournament.The next year I ended up playing for Plugerville.I layed for a team for about 2 years,after that I stoped playing club soccer at the age of 13.My dad still plays soccer even though hes like 44 now, maybe one day I will play again when I get a little older.
	<h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
		<h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>
			My favortie movie is <em>The Batman</em> movie,relesesd on March4th,2022.The lead actor is <em>Robert Pattinson</em> who has also been in the <em>Twilight</em> movies.I like this movie because it has a darker tone to it comapared to the previous Batman films.My favorite scene is at the very begining,when we first see Batman.The way the camera is focused on the dark hall and all you hear is heavy footsteps approaching,and he slowly comes into the light.
		<h3>My Favorite Foods</h3>
			Enchiladas,Pizza,Popusas.
